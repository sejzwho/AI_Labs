# AI_Labs
Welcome to my GitHub repository where I've compiled a comprehensive set of AI practical codes from my college coursework. This repository is a treasure trove of algorithmic solutions and implementation techniques that cover a diverse range of topics. As you explore, you'll find hands-on examples for various AI concepts:

* K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
Explore the KNN algorithm's implementation, a versatile classification technique that finds application in pattern recognition and data analysis.

* Naive Bayes
Delve into the world of probabilistic classifiers with the Naive Bayes algorithm, which excels in text classification and spam filtering.

* Perceptron
Understand neural networks at their core with the Perceptron, a building block for more complex models. This algorithm is fundamental to machine learning.

* A Star Algorithm
Discover the A Star algorithm, a powerful search algorithm commonly used in pathfinding and graph traversal applications.

* Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm
Uncover the BFS algorithm, an essential graph traversal technique that finds widespread application in network exploration and shortest path finding.

* Two Water Jug Problem
Engage in a classic puzzle with the Two Water Jug Problem. This problem challenges your algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.

Each topic is accompanied by well-structured code, clear explanations, and comments to aid your understanding. Whether you're a student looking to grasp AI fundamentals or an enthusiast interested in expanding your knowledge, this repository offers a structured learning path. Feel free to explore, adapt, and contribute as we embark on an enriching AI journey together.
